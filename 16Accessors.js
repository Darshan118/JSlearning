 * ‚úÖ Make computed properties that behave like normal ones.
 * ‚úÖ Encapsulate private properties (conventionally using _propertyName)

 * when person1.name = "Shadow" is executed, the set method runs instead of directly modifying _name.
 * This allows validation (e.g., rejecting names if it's shorter than 3 characters).
